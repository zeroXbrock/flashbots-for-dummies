# flashbots for dummies

The simplest possible example I could come up with to demonstrate how to send tx bundles to Flashbots.

## quick start

1. Get a valid provider URL (key) from [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/).
2. Copy that URL into [`index.js`](./index.js) (line 7).
3. Update the rest of the code as needed.

```sh
npm install
node index.js
```
